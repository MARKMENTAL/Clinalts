# Clinalts
This is a command-line C program designed to help new Linux users or people looking to switch to Linux to find some free/open-source Linux alternatives to their favorite proprietary applications.
It was originally written with Java, but due to the resource overhead of Java and Java not being included on a default install with most Linux distros, C seems to be a better choice of language.
Instructions to install the alternatives on Linux systems with either Debian or Fedora package managers are provided on search.

# Compile/Build Instructions
Simply enter the command `gcc main.c -o Clinalts` (or the equivalent with a different compiler) from within a folder containing the main.c file to compile and build the program. 

A Windows build and source code are available in the `winsrc` and `winbuild` folders for those who want to run the program but are not on a Unix compatible OS.

# Run Instructions
This program contains a Linux build that was made with Debian 11 and GCC, you can also build it yourself. 
Running  `./Clinalts` in a terminal or command line window containing the build will give optimal results.
